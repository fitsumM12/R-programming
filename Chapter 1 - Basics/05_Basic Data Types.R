"Discover Basic Data Types
Some of R's most basic types to get started are:

Decimals values like 4.5 are called numerics.
Natural numbers like 4 are called integers. Integers are also numerics.
Boolean values (TRUE or FALSE) are called logical.
Text (or string) values are called characters.
Note how the quotation marks on the right indicate that is a character."
# What is the answer to the universe?
my_numeric <- 42

# The quotation marks indicate that the variable is of type character
my_character <- "forty-two"

# Change the value of my_logical
my_logical <- FALSE
